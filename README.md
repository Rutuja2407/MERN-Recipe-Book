# MERN-Recipe-Book
Built a Recipe App using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with robust user authentication.  Enabled users to add their own recipes, complete with detailed instructions and ingredients.  Implemented a feature for users to save specific recipes to their personal profiles for easy access.
